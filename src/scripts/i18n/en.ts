    faq_2_q: "Is my API key secure?",
    faq_2_a: "Yes. Your key is stored only in your browser (LocalStorage). It is never sent to our servers (we don't have any!).",
    faq_3_q: "Can I use images commercially?",
    faq_3_a: "Yes, images generated via Replicate or Google Gemini generally belong to you. Check your provider's ToS for details.",
    faq_4_q: "Why is this model better?",
    faq_4_a: "Google Nano Banana Pro was specifically trained to understand complex instructions and handle text, which is the weak point of Midjourney or DALL-E.",
