  <h2>4. Limitation of Editor Liability</h2>

  <h3>Availability</h3>

  <h3>Third-Party Costs</h3>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property of Creations</h2>

  <p>Depending on the current conditions of the AI models used, and subject to Replicate's Terms, the images generated by the User via NanoThumbnail generally belong to them, allowing for commercial use (YouTube, social networks).
