First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. See the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) for different ways to help and details about how this project handles them.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [NanoThumbnail Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## I Have a Question

If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/yoanbernabeu/NanoThumbnail/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

-   Open an [Issue](https://github.com/yoanbernabeu/NanoThumbnail/issues/new).
-   Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
-   Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

-   Make sure that you are using the latest version.
-   Read [documentation](README.md) to find out if the functionality is actually a bug.
-   Run a search on [Issues](https://github.com/yoanbernabeu/NanoThumbnail/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

-   Open an [Issue](https://github.com/yoanbernabeu/NanoThumbnail/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure the bug exists in your local setup or in the code, please provide as much detail as possible).
-   Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
-   Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
-   Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

### Your First Code Contribution

1.  Fork the project.
2.  Create a branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5.  Open a Pull Request.

## Styleguides

### Javascript

-   Please keep the code clean and commented where necessary.
